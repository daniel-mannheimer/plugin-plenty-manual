<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In plentymarkets, it is possible to save different <a href="/en/order-processing/orders/_accounting">accounting information</a> for each client and location. In other words, you can manage multiple clients that all have multiple branch offices in different countries. Every client must have at least one location by default. This standard location corresponds to the company’s main headquarters. The standard location is the first menu item within the <strong>Locations</strong> menu. Every location is identified by a customisable name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The location settings are divided into submenus, e.g. <strong>Settings</strong> and <a href="/en/order-processing/orders/_accounting">Accounting</a>. Different accounting settings can be saved for each location.</p>

<p>Every location has a <strong>Settings</strong> submenu, which you can use to change the location’s name or to delete the location altogether. It is not possible to change a location’s country once it has been created. This helps prevent errors. If you want to change the country, then you will need to create an entirely new location. It is also necessary to specify which location should be the standard or default location. Generally, this is where the company’s main headquarters are located. Open the <a href="/en/omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients#basic-settings">Basic settings</a> menu and select the country from the <strong>Default location</strong> drop-down menu.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is only possible to delete a location if there is at least one other location in this menu as well. It is not possible to delete the location that was set as the <strong>Default location</strong> in the menu <a href="/en/omni-channel/online-store/setting-up-clients#basic-settings">Basic settings</a>.</p>
