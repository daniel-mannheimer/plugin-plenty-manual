2) According to the <strong>priority</strong> of the warehouse (option among the warehouse settings).<br>
In case of sufficient or identical stock in all warehouses, the warehouse will be selected according to priority. The first criterion does not consider the actual amount of stock.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on how you configure your plentymarkets system, it is possible to create a variety of useful combinations that prevent errors from occurring. Conversely, incorrect settings can cause mistakes. For example, you would notice a mistake if you selected a main warehouse for an item but this warehouse didn’t appear on the order. Such a situation could be the result of the automatic warehouse selection that is based on the country of delivery. The mistake could be that one warehouse was automatically assigned based on the country of delivery, but you actually wanted a different warehouse to be assigned based on the particular item. The situation would be even worse if you didn’t save any stock for this particular warehouse. Therefore, these basic settings are very important for ensuring that you can correctly process your orders. Pay attention to any links that exist between the warehouse configuration, the settings that are saved for particular items, the countries of delivery and the basic settings in table 1.</p>
